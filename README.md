# Windows-XP-Shutdown-dialog

Miss the old shutdown and logoff dialogs from Windows XP? This adds these files that you can run and you will have a working shutdown (and logoff) dialog.
This comes with an extended logoff dialog with a lock option (useful for Windows 7 where lock and switch user were two different options).

The package comes with a psshutdown ile for it to work.

Known issues:
- Display doesn't turn gray
- The window sometimes doesn't close after clicking an option
- Pressing standby with hibernation turned on hibernates the system instead of putting it to sleep mode

Installing with exe pairs a file extension (.winshut) with the executable so it can be accessed easily
